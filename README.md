## Description
Daily Diary Hub will be a web app that allows users to write a short note about how their day went. Each Entry is stored so that users can scroll back and look at what they have written before. The app is meant to inspire daily positivity so it will have customizable themes and rotating positive messages displayed when the user logs in. 

## Deployment
To deploy Daily Diary Hub you must have access to a mongoDB server and use npx nodemon server while in the backend directory as well as npm start while in the front-end directory. This will replicate my development environrment. Input your own Atlas URI in the backend/.env or directly in the server.js folder.
